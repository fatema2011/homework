 * 
 * Q 1: HW07A: Hemoglobin A1C is measured to determine - you are diabetic or not. Now, Create a package name --> "hw7UseOfNestedIf" inside your HW project. Create a Class, named "DiabeticCondition". Type the main method. 
 * 
 * After the main method, print -- "<-- Please Enter your Hemoglobin A1C value below -->". Instantiate Scanner class to type your Hemoglobin A1C value in the console. Declare a double type variable hbA1c and initialize it by scanner.nextDouble(). Now write some conditions. a) If your hbA1c value is more than 6.4, the outcome will be "I am a diabetic patient". b) If your hbA1c value is not more than 6.4, Congratulation! you are not diabetic. Now introduce the nested if condition below. if hbA1c >= 5.7, the outcome will be "I am a pre-diabetic patient". if hbA1c < 5.7, the outcome will be "I am a healthy person". In the above conditions, use an appropriate keyword like if, else if, or else to execute your health condition. Please organize the code. Any white space is not acceptable. push the code to GitHub and add the link below.
